# IRWA-2021-final-project

### Introduction
This is the final project of the course I.R.W.A. Between the different released parts, we pre-process the text of tweets to have them cleaned, tokenaize and stemmed so that we can build different search engines: based on the inverted indexing and the TF-IDF ranking algorithm, based on an invented score by us, and based on Word2Vec embeddings (part3), all using cosine similarity between the tweets and the query. Additionally, in part2, we evaluate the search engine (based on TF-IDF ranking) using different evaluation techniques on 5 proposed queries we chose. Finally, in part 2 also, we represent the tweets in a 2-dimensional scatter plot using the T-SNE algorithm. 

Finally, in this last released part (part4) we give the search engine we have been owrking on a user interface and perform some web analytics about the usage from the users of the search engine.
