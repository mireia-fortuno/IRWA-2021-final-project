# IRWA-2021-final-project-part-1

### Introduction
This is the first part of the final project of the course I.R.W.A. In this 1st part, we pre-process the text of tweets to have them cleaned, tokenaized and stemmed so that later on we can build a search engine with different indexing and ranking algorithms.

### Requirements

These following libraries of python are required to run the script:
- nltk
- json
- re
- emoji

If you do not have some of this libraries installed, you can do so by doing:
`pip install nltk`, `pip install json`, `pip install re` or `pip install emoji`

### How to run the project
To run the code, run all the cells in the order that they are in, i.e. from 1st to last. 
The first cell is to import all the needed libraries and their modules.
The second cell is to read the data and store it in the decided data structure.
The fourth cell is the function that will pre-process the text.
The last cell is the actual pre-processing of the text, where the text will be modified and stored in the same space.

In this case, there are no available options to choose from, there is only one possible way to pre-process these texts.
