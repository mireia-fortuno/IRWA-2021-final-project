# IRWA-2021-final-project

### Introduction
This is the final project of the course I.R.W.A. Between the differentreleased parts, we pre-process the text of tweets to have them cleaned, tokenaize and stemm so that we can build different search engines: based on the inverted indexing and the TF-IDF ranking algorithm, based on an invented score by us, and based on Word2Vec embeddings, all using cosine similarity between the tweets and the query. Additionally, in part2, we evaluate the search engine (based on TF-IDF ranking) using different evaluation techniques on 5 proposed queries we chose. Finally, in part 2 alos, we represent the tweets in a 2-dimensional scatter plot using the T-SNE algorithm.
