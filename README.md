# IRWA-2021-final-project

### Introduction
This is the final project of the course I.R.W.A. In this 2nd released part, we pre-process the text of tweets to have them cleaned, tokenaized and stemmed so that we can build a search engine based on the inverted indexing and the TF-IDF ranking algorithm. Additionally, we evaluate the search engine using different evaluation techniques based on 5 proposed queries we chose. Finally, we represent the tweets in a 2-dimensional scatter plot using the T-SNE algorithm.
